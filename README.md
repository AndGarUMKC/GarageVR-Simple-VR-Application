# GarageVR-Simple-VR-Application

This project focuses on the development of a simple virtual reality (VR) application using Unity. The application utilizes C# scripts for programming logic and Blender for creating 3D models. Additionally, an app file is provided, which can be uploaded to a Meta Quest 2 headset for immersive VR experiences.

## Project Overview

The VR application aims to provide users with an interactive and immersive experience in a virtual environment. By leveraging Unity's powerful capabilities and integrating 3D models created in Blender, the project brings virtual worlds to life. Users can explore, interact, and engage with the virtual environment through their Meta Quest 2 headset.

## Technologies Used

The project involves the use of the following technologies:

- **Unity**: Unity is a popular game development engine that provides a comprehensive framework for creating interactive 3D and 2D experiences. It offers a wide range of tools and features for building VR applications.

- **C# Scripts**: C# is the programming language used within the Unity environment to create logic and functionality for the VR application. It allows for the implementation of various interactive elements and behaviors.

- **Blender**: Blender is an open-source software used for creating 3D models, animations, and visual effects. It enables the development of custom 3D assets to be used within the VR application.

- **Meta Quest 2**: Meta Quest 2 is a popular standalone VR headset. The app file provided is specifically designed to be uploaded to the Meta Quest 2 headset and played on this device.

## Usage

To use the VR application on the Meta Quest 2 headset:

1. Ensure that the headset is charged and powered on.

2. Put on the headset and adjust it for a comfortable fit.

3. Navigate to the applications section on the Meta Quest 2 interface.

4. Locate and select the uploaded VR application to launch it.

5. Interact with the virtual environment using the Meta Quest 2 controllers or other input methods specified within the application.

## Future Enhancements

The VR application can be further improved and expanded with additional features and functionality. Some potential enhancements include:

- Integration of more complex interactions
